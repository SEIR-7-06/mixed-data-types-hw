// 1. Data types

// * A boolean where true means is on and false means off.  I would use a function tha would return true if it was on and false if it was off.
// * I would use a string for the email.  The data structure I would use would be an object where one of the key-value pairs is email address and their email.
// * I would make an array of strings for the spaceship with the hull, laser blasters, tractor beams and warp drive as indices.
// * The names would be strings, and they would be in array.
// * The names and locations would be strings and they would be in an object of the student.
// * The names, locations, and shows would be strings in an object of the student.  The shows would be in an array in the obect.
